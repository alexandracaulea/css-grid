# CSS Grid Layout Presentation

Check out the website here: https://learncssgrid.netlify.app/

During my Web Developer Internship I had the task to create a presentation about CSS Grid Layout and present it to my colleagues.

I decided to take this requirement a bit further and create an entire webpage about CSS Grid that will help my fellow colleagues to deep dive into CSS Grid.
For this presentation I also created 23 code examples on CodePen.

The entire collection can be found on CodePen: https://codepen.io/collection/DEONLQ

I've decided to publish online the presentation thinking maybe someone will find it useful: https://learncssgrid.netlify.app/
